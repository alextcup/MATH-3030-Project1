	abstract = {We prove that the distribution of the number of steps of the Euclidean algorithm of rationals in imaginary quadratic fields with denominators bounded by 𝑁 is asymptotically Gaussian as 𝑁 goes to infinity, extending a result by Baladi and Vallée for the real case. The proof is based on the spectral analysis of the transfer operator associated to the nearest integer complex continued fraction map, which is piecewise analytic and expanding but not a full branch map. By observing a finite Markov partition with a regular CW-structure, which enables us to associate the transfer operator acting on a direct sum of spaces of 𝐶1-functions, we obtain the limit Gaussian distribution as well as residual equidistribution.},

	abstract = {We obtain a central limit theorem for a general class of additive parameters (costs, observables) associated to three standard Euclidean algorithms, with optimal speed of convergence. We also provide very precise asymptotic estimates and error terms for the mean and variance of such parameters. For costs that are lattice (including the number of steps), we go further and establish a local limit theorem, with optimal speed of convergence. We view an algorithm as a dynamical system restricted to rational inputs, and combine tools imported from dynamics, such as transfer operators, with various other techniques: Dirichlet series, Perron’s formula, quasi-powers theorems, and the saddle-point method. Such dynamical analyses had previously been used to perform the average-case analysis of algorithms. For the present (dynamical) analysis in distribution, we require estimates on transfer operators when a parameter varies along vertical lines in the complex plane. To prove them, we adapt techniques introduced recently by Dolgopyat in the context of continuous-time dynamics (Ann. Math. 147 (1998) 357).},
